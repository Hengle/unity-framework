Whether it was home-rolled or an off the shelf solution the very structure of your code base makes up the framework it executes on.  If you've ever finished, or worse started and not finished, a project using the Unity3D engine you realize the importance of well structuring your code.  If find yourself re-implementing the same functionality from project to project time and time again then you are a great candidate for migrating your work-flow into a framework package.\r\n\r\n## What CleaveFramework can do for you\r\n\r\nIf you're writing code that looks like:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nTheGlobals.GameManager.Game.WorldManager.World.SpawnPlayer(TheGlobals.GameManager.Game.PlayerManager.MakeNewPlayer());\r\nTheGlobals.GameManager.Game.HUDManager.ShowWelcomeMsg(TheGlobals.GameManager.Game.PlayerManager.Player.Name);\r\nTheGlobals.GameManager.Game.Sounds.PlaySound(GameSounds.WelcomeSound);\r\n// etc...\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr worse yet: you dream of one day writing code that looks that clean.  You're in dire need of a better structure and work-flow.\r\n\r\nYou could write this snippet utilizing framework features in one line:\r\n```csharp\r\nFramework.Dispatch(new SpawnNewPlayerCmd());\r\n```\r\nYou'll have to read further to see how powerful the Command Dispatching system is, and hopefully that alone has got you interested.\r\n\r\nThe framework was created to assist in creating and maintaining a better structure for you by implementing several core features.  However most of the framework itself remains modular and you can pick and choose how much or little of it you want to use and how you want to use it.\r\n\r\nThe framework will not constrain you in to working within one particular design paradigm.  Bits and pieces of it's implementation can be constructed together to form a flow that makes the best sense for you and your project.\r\n\r\nWhat the framework is not is perfect.  We need your help and feedback to make this a great usable piece of software that programmers of all skill levels can use, learn from, and make great games with.\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n### [About](https://github.com/cleavetv/unity-framework/blob/master/Docs/About.md)\r\n### [Installation](https://github.com/cleavetv/unity-framework/blob/master/Docs/Installation.md)\r\n### [Core Principals](https://github.com/cleavetv/unity-framework/blob/master/Docs/CorePrincipals.md)\r\n### [Basic Example Usage](https://github.com/cleavetv/unity-framework/blob/master/Docs/BasicUsage.md)\r\n### [Sample Project](https://github.com/cleavetv/unity-framework/blob/master/Docs/CleaveFrameworkSampleProject.md)\r\n### [Framework Objects](https://github.com/cleavetv/unity-framework/blob/master/Docs/FrameworkObjectsTOC.md)\r\n### [Interfaces](https://github.com/cleavetv/unity-framework/blob/master/Docs/Interfaces.md)\r\n### [Quick Snippets](https://github.com/cleavetv/unity-framework/blob/master/Docs/QuickSnippets.md)\r\n### [Contributions](https://github.com/cleavetv/unity-framework/blob/master/Docs/Contributions.md)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
